# MetaPath Unity Application

This is the MetaPath Unity Application which will be used by the customers and users to navigate and travel the world using VR Equipment.


The project is built in Unity using the WRLD3D SDK as a backbone to include a copy of the real world as a interactable set of Game Objects inside Unity

see: *https://www.wrld3d.com/unity/latest/docs/examples/*


 The project is running on Unity 2019.4.36f1 as the WRLD3D SDK does offer support for small range of versions and this one turned to be the most stable
 
 see: *https://www.wrld3d.com/unity/latest/docs/api/*
 
 
 To download the project, do a git pull on the repository inside your Unity project folder:
 
 see *https://github.com/aldimitrov14/metapath-unity/*
 
 
 To run the project you have to load the scene before starting. To do so, follow the steps:
 
 1. Open the project in Unity using the Unity Hub or the Unity Editor itself
 2. In the Project Browser (the UI Interface where you can browse through the project folders) find the folder */Assets/Scenes/MetaPath*
 3. Load the MetaPath scene by double clicking it
 4. Either use the play button or use the Build and Run Function *File -> Build and Run* (CTRL + B)
 
>Note: From there you can choose your desired route (only two are available) and select it from the dropdown menu. In the Play button (not the build and run) sometimes the screen freezes so you have to left click it to unfreezes, as far as we know this is an Unity issue.
